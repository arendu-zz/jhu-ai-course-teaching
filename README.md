1. Minimax algorithm.
2. Completely solving the game in checkmate puzzle (feasible since it only requires looking a couple moves ahead).
3. Evaluation function (allows to avoid exploring the full game tree by approximating desirability of a board positions).

5. Combines all introduced concepts into chess-playing agent.
6. Allows students to play against the agent or observe the agent playing against itself.
