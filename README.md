# JHU Ai Course Resources

AI course resources created during my Teaching Assistantship with Prof. Philipp Koehn at Johns Hopkins University.

## Game playing [[colab notebook]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/warmspringwinds/jhu-ai-course-teaching/blob/master/game_playing/notebook.ipynb) [[jupyter notebook]](game_playing/notebook.ipynb) [[slides]](game_playing/lecture_slides.pdf)

Jupyter notebook that guides a student through:

<p align="center">

1. Minimax algorithm.
2. Completely solving the game in checkmate puzzle (feasible since it only requires looking a couple of moves ahead).
3. Evaluation function (allows to avoid exploring the full game tree by approximating desirability of a board positions).
4. Alpha-beta prunning algorithm (prunes nodes that are known to not affect the final decision in mini-max).
5. Combines all introduced concepts into chess-playing agent.
6. Allows students to play against the agent or observe the agent playing against itself.
