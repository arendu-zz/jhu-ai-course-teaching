JHU Ai course resources created during my Teaching Assistantship with Prof. Philipp Koehn.

## Game playing

Jupyter notebook that guides a student through:

1. Minimax algorithm.
2. Uses it to completely solve the game in checkmate puzzle -- since it only requires looking a couple moves ahead.
3. Evaluation function that is used to evaluate the board position -- which allows to avoid exploring the full game tree.
4. Alpha-beta prunning algorithm.
5. Combines all introduced concepts into chess-playing agent.
6. Allows students to play against the agent or observe the agent playing against itself.
